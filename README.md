Hi, Iâ€™m Riley Kuhlman. I like to code things, but, more importantly, I like to save things that I have coded badly... There is a lot of garbage on my Github.

Most of the coolest stuff is under my rocket-simulation repository, but quite a bit of it is hidden in a mess of spaghetti code. I started working on it for the Goddard 2022 rocket at Brazoswood, but I have tried to generalize the code so that it would work decently for most small scale model rockets. It also has a pretty advanced hybrid engine simulation, with a respectable implementation of the equilibrium model for self-pressurizing nitrous blowdown.

I also made http://prospect-theory.herokuapp.com/, which is pretty interesting if you are willing to wait 15 seconds for it to load (unfortunately Heroku does not automatically zip the files it serves and I think I also uploaded the dev build).
