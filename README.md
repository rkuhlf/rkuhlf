Hi, Iâ€™m Riley Kuhlman. I am a freshman at Rice University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Engineering Design. I have been programming for about five years now, starting off in web dev and moving on through game dev and a little bit of data science and numerical analysis. At this point, most of my code is some form of mathematical simulation or an algorithm for my computer science class.

Most of the coolest stuff is under my rocket-simulation repository, but quite a bit of it is hidden in a mess of spaghetti code. I started working on it for the Goddard 2022 Horizon 1 rocket at Brazoswood, but I have tried to generalize the code so that it would work decently for most small scale model rockets. It also has a pretty advanced hybrid engine simulation, with a respectable implementation of the equilibrium model for self-pressurizing nitrous blowdown. Ultimately, it ended up predicting the flight of [our world-record rocket](https://sites.google.com/student.brazosportisd.net/goddard2022) to within 5%, which is probably my proudest achievement to date.

I have the most experience with web dev in React, having made about five decent little projects that are deployed with it. One of those is https://prospecttheory.vercel.app/, which is a pretty interesting bit of economics. It covers the mathematics behind prospect theory, a new-ish approach to quantifying decision making that incorporates many human irrationalities into the more traditional utility theory.
