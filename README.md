Hi, I’m Riley Kuhlman. I like to code things, but, more importantly, I like to save things that I have coded badly, so there is a lot of garbage on my Github. Most of the coolest stuff is under my rocket-simulation repository, but quite a bit of it is hidden in a mess of spaghetti code. I also made http://prospect-theory.herokuapp.com/, which is pretty cool if you are willing to wait 15 seconds for it to load (unfortunately Heroku does not automatically zip the files it serves and I think I also uploaded the dev build).
